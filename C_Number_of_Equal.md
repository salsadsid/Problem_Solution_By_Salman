Thank you for the correction. Let's revisit the analysis based on the updated second solution, which is similar to the first but has a minor difference. This difference leads to a correct result, unlike the first version.

### Updated Second Solution:

```cpp
int l=0,r=0;
long long int sum=0;

while(l<n && r<m) {
    int curr=ar1[l], cnt1=0, cnt2=0;

    while(l<n && ar1[l]==curr) {
        cnt1++;
        l++;
    }
    while(r<m && ar2[r]<curr) {
        r++;
    }
    while(r<m && ar2[r]==curr) {
        r++;
        cnt2++;
    }

    sum += (1LL * cnt1 * cnt2);
}

cout << sum << endl;
```

### Key Difference Between the Two Solutions:

- **In the first solution**: The second `while` loop moves the `r` pointer only when `ar2[r] != curr`, meaning it skips processing the current `curr` in `ar2` when the value in `ar2` is not equal to `curr`. This causes elements in `ar2` to potentially be skipped if they are not processed at the right time.
- **In the updated second solution**: The second `while` loop moves `r` forward **only when** `ar2[r] < curr`. This ensures that all elements in `ar2` are processed in the correct order without skipping any elements. Once `ar2[r] == curr`, the third `while` loop counts the number of occurrences of `curr` in `ar2` and ensures all occurrences are considered.

### Example to Clarify:

Consider the following arrays:

```
n = 5, m = 6
a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
b = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
```

Let's break down the difference in execution between the two solutions:

#### First Solution (Wrong Answer):

- `l = 0, r = 0`: `curr = 1`, `ar1[l] = 1`, but `ar2[r] = 2` is greater than `1`. The first `while` moves `l` forward, but the second `while` skips processing the `2`s in `ar2` entirely because `ar2[r] != curr`, missing all potential matches for `2` in `ar2`.

#### Updated Second Solution (Correct Answer):

- `l = 0, r = 0`: `curr = 1`, `ar1[l] = 1`, but `ar2[r] = 2`. Since `ar2[r] > curr`, `r` is not moved forward unnecessarily.
- `l = 1, r = 0`: `curr = 2`, `ar1[l] = 2`, and the loop correctly finds the `2`s in both arrays without skipping them.

Thus, the updated second solution correctly handles cases where elements in `ar2` are greater than the current element from `ar1`, ensuring no pairs are missed.

### Conclusion:

The issue with the first solution was due to incorrectly advancing the pointer `r` when there wasn't an exact match between `ar1[l]` and `ar2[r]`. The updated second solution handles this properly by ensuring it only moves `r` when necessary and counts all matching pairs, leading to the correct result.

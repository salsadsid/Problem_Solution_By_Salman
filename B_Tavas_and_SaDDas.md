To solve this problem using **bit manipulation**, we can take advantage of the fact that lucky numbers (numbers containing only the digits `4` and `7`) can be viewed as a kind of "binary representation". Specifically, we can treat `4` as `0` and `7` as `1`, converting the lucky number into a binary-like number. This makes it easy to calculate its position in the sorted list of lucky numbers.

Here's how the bit manipulation approach works:

### Key Idea:

- Treat `4` as `0` and `7` as `1`.
- Convert the lucky number into a binary number, where the leftmost digit is the most significant bit, and the rightmost digit is the least significant bit.
- We need to also account for all the lucky numbers with fewer digits than `n`, as those will come before `n` in the sorted list.

### Steps:

1. **Convert the digits to binary-like values**:
   - For each digit in the number, treat `4` as `0` and `7` as `1`. Construct the binary number by shifting and adding the value of each digit.
2. **Count all lucky numbers with fewer digits**:

   - For each number of digits smaller than the length of `n`, there are `2^d` lucky numbers, where `d` is the number of digits.

3. **Combine both results** to get the 1-based index of `n` in the sorted list of lucky numbers.

### Bit Manipulation Approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string n;
    cin >> n;

    int length = n.size();
    int index = 0;

    // Calculate the binary-like representation of the lucky number
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (n[i] == '7') {
            index |= (1 << (length - i - 1));  // Set the corresponding bit if the digit is '7'
        }
    }

    // Add the count of all lucky numbers with fewer digits
    for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
        index += (1 << i);  // Add 2^i for each number of digits less than 'length'
    }

    // Output the 1-based index
    cout << index + 1 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input**:

   - The input is a string `n` representing a lucky number.

2. **Binary-Like Conversion**:

   - We iterate through each digit of the number `n`.
   - If the digit is `7`, we set the corresponding bit in the `index` variable using bit manipulation (`index |= (1 << (length - i - 1))`). This converts the lucky number into a binary-like number where `4` is treated as `0` and `7` is treated as `1`.

3. **Counting Lucky Numbers with Fewer Digits**:

   - For each number of digits smaller than `length`, there are `2^i` lucky numbers. We add these counts to the `index`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After the loops, the `index` variable holds the 0-based index of the lucky number `n`. Since the problem asks for a 1-based index, we output `index + 1`.

### Example:

#### Input: `n = 77`

- `n = "77"`, length = 2.
- First, the binary-like conversion:

  - For the first digit (`7`), we set the most significant bit (`1 << 1 = 2`).
  - For the second digit (`7`), we set the least significant bit (`1 << 0 = 1`).
  - So, `index = 2 + 1 = 3`.

- Now, we add all lucky numbers with fewer digits. There are `2^1 = 2` one-digit lucky numbers (4 and 7), so we add `2` to `index`.

- The final `index = 3 + 2 = 5`.

- Since the problem asks for a 1-based index, we print `index + 1 = 6`.

#### Output: `6`

This solution uses bit manipulation to efficiently compute the result while minimizing operations and memory usage.

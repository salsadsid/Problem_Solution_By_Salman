The given C++ solution is solving the problem by determining if the array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing the described rotation operation. Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Reading Input:**

```cpp
cin >> t;
while(t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
}
```

- Read the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, read the size of the array `n` and then the elements of the array `a`.

#### 2. **Identifying the First Breakpoint:**

```cpp
int pos = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
        pos = i;
        break;
    }
}
```

- Traverse the array to find the first position `pos` where the array is not in non-decreasing order (`a[i] > a[i + 1]`).
- If no such position is found (`pos = 0`), the array is already sorted, and we output `"Yes"`.

---

#### 3. **Handling the Breakpoint:**

If a breakpoint (`pos`) exists, the algorithm checks whether the array can be rearranged by rotation to become sorted:

```cpp
if(!pos) cout << "Yes\n";
else {
    int fl = 0;
    for(int i = pos + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int j = (i % n) + 1;
        if(a[i] > a[j]) fl = 1;
    }
    if(!fl) cout << "Yes\n";
    else cout << "No\n";
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code Logic:

1. **Start Checking from the Breakpoint:**

   - If the array can be rotated to become sorted, then:
     - After the breakpoint, all elements should either match the sorted order or wrap around to the start of the array.
   - This is validated by the loop:
     ```cpp
     for(int i = pos + 1; i <= n; i++) {
         int j = (i % n) + 1;
         if(a[i] > a[j]) fl = 1;
     }
     ```
     - `j = (i % n) + 1` ensures that after reaching the end of the array, the comparison wraps around to the beginning.

2. **Set a Flag (`fl`)**:

   - If any element fails the condition `a[i] ≤ a[j]`, the flag `fl` is set to `1`, indicating that the array cannot be made sorted by rotation.

3. **Output Result:**
   - If `fl == 0`, it means the array can be rotated into a sorted order, and `"Yes"` is printed.
   - Otherwise, `"No"` is printed.

### Why Is This Solution Correct?

1. **Breakpoint Detection:**

   - The solution identifies the first breakpoint where the order is broken (`a[i] > a[i+1]`).
   - This is critical because, for the array to be sorted by rotation, there can only be one breakpoint where this happens.

2. **Rotation Simulation:**

   - By iterating from `pos + 1` to `n` and wrapping around to the beginning (`j = (i % n) + 1`), the solution effectively simulates all possible rotations.

3. **Validation of Sorted Order:**

   - The solution checks if all elements follow a non-decreasing order after the breakpoint, including the wrap-around.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The algorithm is efficient:
     - It runs in **O(n)** per test case to find the breakpoint and validate the rotation.
     - For multiple test cases, the complexity is **O(t × n)**, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:

```
1
6
3 4 5 6 1 2
```

#### Execution:

1. **Detect Breakpoint:**

   - Traverse the array: `3 ≤ 4 ≤ 5 ≤ 6 > 1`.
   - Breakpoint at `pos = 4`.

2. **Validate Rotation:**

   - Start from `pos + 1 = 5`:
     - Compare `1 ≤ 2`.
     - Compare `2 ≤ 3` (wrap-around using `j = (i % n) + 1`).
   - All conditions are satisfied.

3. **Output:**
   - `"Yes"` because the array can be rotated to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

#### Input:

```
1
6
3 4 6 5 1 2
```

#### Execution:

1. **Detect Breakpoint:**

   - Traverse the array: `3 ≤ 4 ≤ 6 > 5`.
   - Breakpoint at `pos = 3`.

2. **Validate Rotation:**

   - Start from `pos + 1 = 4`:
     - Compare `5 ≤ 1` fails (rotation is not possible).
   - Flag `fl = 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - `"No"` because the array cannot be rotated to become sorted.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Finding the breakpoint: **O(n)**.
  - Validating rotation: **O(n)**.
  - Total for each test case: **O(n)**.
  - Total for all test cases: **O(t × n)**.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space: **O(1)**.

This makes the solution optimal for the problem constraints.

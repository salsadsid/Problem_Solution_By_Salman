### Problem Understanding

The goal is to minimize the size of the array after performing a sequence of operations where:

- You can remove two different elements from the array in each operation.
- The problem is essentially about pairing up elements of the same value as much as possible, so after removing all possible pairs, we are left with as few elements as possible.

### Thought Process Behind the Code:

1. **Using a Map to Count Frequencies:**

   - The solution starts by creating a frequency map (`mp`) that counts how many times each number appears in the array.
   - This is essential because we need to know how many pairs can be formed from each number in the array.

   ```cpp
   map<int,int> mp;
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       int x;
       cin>>x;
       mp[x]++;
   }
   ```

2. **Using a Priority Queue to Maximize Pairing:**

   - Once we have the frequency of each number, the next step is to maximize the pairing.
   - To do that, the solution uses a **priority queue** (`pq`), which stores the frequencies of elements in descending order (since it's a max-heap by default).
   - Why a max-heap? Because at each step, we want to pick the two elements with the largest frequencies to remove a pair and reduce their counts.

   ```cpp
   priority_queue<int> pq;
   for (auto [x,y]:mp)
   {
       pq.push(y);
   }
   ```

3. **Pairing Logic:**

   - The pairing process happens while there are at least two different frequencies left in the heap. We extract the two largest frequencies, reduce them by 1 (since we remove one instance of each from the array), and if the resulting frequency is still greater than zero, we push it back into the heap.
   - This ensures that we're always trying to remove the most common elements first, maximizing the pairing.

   ```cpp
   while(!pq.empty())
   {
       if(pq.size()<2) break;

       int x=pq.top();
       pq.pop();
       int y=pq.top();
       pq.pop();

       x--;
       y--;

       if(x>=1) pq.push(x);
       if(y>=1) pq.push(y);
   }
   ```

   **Key Insight:**

   - By always pairing the two most frequent elements, you minimize the number of leftover elements that can't be paired.

4. **Summing Remaining Elements:**

   - After pairing as much as possible, if there's any frequency left in the heap, it means these elements couldn't be paired. The sum of these remaining frequencies will be the size of the array after all operations are performed.

   ```cpp
   int sum=0;
   while(!pq.empty())
   {
       sum+=pq.top();
       pq.pop();
   }
   ```

### Why This Solution is Beautiful:

1. **Efficiency with Priority Queue:**

   - The priority queue is a great choice here since it allows you to repeatedly access and remove the most frequent elements in logarithmic time. This ensures that the solution is efficient even when the input size is large.

2. **Greedy Approach:**

   - The approach is greedy in nature: by always picking the two most frequent elements, you're reducing the size of the array as fast as possible. This greedy strategy is optimal for this problem.

3. **Simple yet Effective:**

   - The use of a frequency map and priority queue simplifies the problem without requiring complex logic. It's a clear, concise, and efficient approach.

4. **Handling Edge Cases Implicitly:**
   - If there are no more pairs to remove (i.e., when `pq.size() < 2`), the loop breaks. This elegantly handles cases where no more operations can be performed.

### Time Complexity:

- **Building the frequency map** takes \(O(n)\) for each test case.
- **Filling the priority queue** takes \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of distinct elements.
- The while loop runs for \(O(k \log k)\), because in each iteration, we are removing and reinserting elements into the priority queue, and there are at most \(k\) elements.
- Overall, the complexity per test case is \(O(n + k \log k)\), where \(n\) is the size of the array and \(k\) is the number of distinct elements.

Since the sum of \(n\) over all test cases doesn't exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), this solution efficiently handles the problem within the constraints.

### Output Handling:

However, the code you provided is missing the output statement at the end of each test case. You can simply print the value of `sum` after processing each test case, like this:

```cpp
cout << sum << "\n";
```

### Conclusion:

This solution is both **elegant** and **efficient**, making great use of data structures like maps and priority queues to solve the problem optimally.

## why can't we just chose two different numbers?

The reason we don't just choose two arbitrary different numbers is that this strategy wouldn't minimize the array size as efficiently. Here's why:

1. **Maximizing Reductions**: By always choosing the two largest frequencies, you're guaranteed to remove the most elements in each operation. If you pick smaller frequencies, you'll remove fewer elements, and you'll likely be left with more elements in the end.

2. **Preventing Smaller Frequencies from Accumulating**: If you don't focus on the largest frequencies, smaller frequencies could accumulate in the array, making it harder to remove them later. This leads to a less optimal reduction in array size.

3. **Efficiency**: Pairing the most frequent elements reduces the array more quickly, minimizing the number of leftover elements. Arbitrarily picking any two different numbers might leave behind more elements that can't be paired effectively, leading to a larger final array size.

In short, choosing the two largest frequencies ensures you're making the most impact with each operation, directly reducing the array size faster than simply picking any two different elements.

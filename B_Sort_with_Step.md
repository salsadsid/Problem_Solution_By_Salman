The approach you've outlined is based on analyzing **modulo constraints** in the permutation and the number of misplaced elements. Let’s break down why this approach is correct:

### Problem Overview:

- You're given a permutation `p` of length `n` and a fixed distance `k`. You can only swap elements whose indices differ by exactly `k`.
- You're allowed to make one preliminary swap (between any two elements) to make the permutation easier to sort with the given `k`.
- The goal is to determine:
  1. If the permutation can be sorted without any preliminary swap.
  2. If it can be sorted by making **exactly one** preliminary swap.
  3. If it’s impossible to sort the permutation, even with one preliminary swap.

### Key Observations:

1. **Modulo Grouping**: Since you can only swap elements that are at positions where the index difference is exactly `k`, the problem can be viewed as sorting the permutation within **groups of elements** that share the same remainder when their index is divided by `k`. In other words, each element at index `i` can only be swapped with elements at indices `i ± k, i ± 2k, etc.`, meaning these elements form distinct **groups** based on their position modulo `k`.

2. **Correct Placement Condition**: For each element at index `i`, the correct position of element `p[i]` must satisfy:
   \[
   p[i] \% k = i \% k
   \]
   This means that element `p[i]` must lie in the same modulo `k` group as its correct position in a sorted array. If it doesn't, then it's out of place and counted as a "bad" element.

### Approach:

1. **Count the Misplaced Elements**: You loop through the array and check how many elements are misplaced according to the modulo condition. If `p[i] % k != i % k`, then element `p[i]` is in the wrong group, and you increment a counter (`bad`).

2. **Three Scenarios**:

   - **`bad == 0` (already sorted)**: If no elements are misplaced, the permutation is already sorted, and the answer is `0`.

   - **`bad == 2` (fixable by one swap)**: If exactly **two elements** are misplaced, this can potentially be fixed by swapping the two misplaced elements. After the swap, both of them will be in the correct group, and the permutation will become sortable using the given `k`. Therefore, the answer is `1`.

   - **`bad > 2` (not fixable by one swap)**: If more than two elements are misplaced, it’s impossible to fix the permutation with just one swap, because you'd need more than one swap to place all elements in their correct modulo group. Hence, the answer is `-1`.

### Why the Approach is Correct:

- **Modulo-based Grouping**: Since you're only allowed to swap elements with a fixed distance of `k`, the grouping based on indices modulo `k` is the natural way to think about which elements can be swapped. This leads directly to checking whether each element is in the correct modulo group.

- **Counting Misplaced Elements**: If more than 2 elements are misplaced, a single swap will not be sufficient to sort the permutation. This is because a swap only fixes two positions, and you can't "move" more than two elements to their correct positions with just one swap.

- **Handling the Case with 2 Misplaced Elements**: If there are exactly two misplaced elements, they can be swapped to their correct positions, because swapping those two elements will put both of them in the correct modulo group, making the array sortable.

- **Efficiency**: This approach runs in \(O(n)\) for each test case because it only requires one pass through the array to count misplaced elements, making it efficient enough given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The approach is based on grouping elements by their positions modulo `k` and counting how many elements are misplaced. It correctly identifies when no preliminary swap is needed (`bad == 0`), when exactly one preliminary swap can fix the permutation (`bad == 2`), and when even one swap won't suffice (`bad > 2`). Therefore, it efficiently solves the problem with the correct output in each scenario.

### Problem Explanation:

You are given an array of integers and need to determine if it can become non-decreasing after performing the following operation any number of times:

1. Split the array into two parts (prefix and suffix).
2. Swap these two parts.

### Approach Explanation:

#### Key Insight:

To solve this problem, the key observation is that swapping parts of the array essentially rotates the array. Therefore, you can visualize the problem as determining whether the array can be rotated to form a non-decreasing array.

In simpler terms:

- If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is **"Yes"** because no rotations are needed.
- If the array is not sorted, check if there is exactly **one place** where the array breaks the non-decreasing order. If such a place exists and the remaining part of the array is non-decreasing, then the answer is **"Yes"** (because it means the array can be rotated). Otherwise, the answer is **"No."**

#### Steps of the Approach:

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array elements.
2. **Initial Sorted Check**: Check if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, print "Yes."
3. **Find First Violation**: If the array is not fully sorted, find the first position where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
4. **Check Post Violation**: After the first violation, check whether the rest of the array remains non-decreasing. If so, the array can be rotated to form a non-decreasing sequence; otherwise, it cannot.

### Updated Solution with Variable Names:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_ARRAY_SIZE = 1e5 + 10; // Maximum possible array size
int a[MAX_ARRAY_SIZE]; // Array to hold input values

int main() {
    int testCases; // Number of test cases
    cin >> testCases;

    while(testCases--) {
        int arraySize; // Size of the array for this test case
        cin >> arraySize;

        // Reading the array elements
        for(int i = 1; i <= arraySize; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        int rotationPoint = 0; // To store the position of the first violation (if any)

        // Check where the array stops being non-decreasing
        for(int i = 1; i < arraySize; i++) {
            if(a[i] > a[i + 1]) {
                rotationPoint = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        // If no violation found, array is already non-decreasing
        if(rotationPoint == 0) {
            cout << "Yes\n";
        } else {
            // Check if the remaining part of the array after the violation is non-decreasing
            bool isRotatable = true;
            for(int i = rotationPoint + 1; i <= arraySize; i++) {
                int nextIndex = (i % arraySize) + 1; // Circular check (wraps around)
                if(a[i] > a[nextIndex]) {
                    isRotatable = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            // Output result based on whether the array is rotatable
            if(isRotatable) {
                cout << "Yes\n";
            } else {
                cout << "No\n";
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

```

### Detailed Walkthrough of Example:

#### Example 1:

Input:

```
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
```

1. The array is `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
2. The first violation happens between `5` and `1` (at position 4). Hence, `rotationPoint = 4`.
3. After the violation, we check the rest of the array:
   - Compare `1` with `4` (circular check): it's fine because `1 < 4`.
4. The array is not rotatable into a non-decreasing sequence. Output is **"No."**

#### Example 2:

Input:

```
5
7 9 2 2 3
```

1. The array is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.
2. The first violation happens between `9` and `2`. Hence, `rotationPoint = 2`.
3. After the violation, the rest of the array is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
4. The array can be rotated into `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`. Output is **"Yes."**

#### Example 3:

Input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

1. The array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. There are no violations; the array is already sorted.
3. Output is **"Yes."**

### Why This Approach Works:

- The approach detects whether the array has one violation (a point where the non-decreasing order breaks) and checks if rotating the array after that point will yield a sorted array.
- Since we are allowed to split and swap parts of the array, identifying this violation helps us determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

The solution aims to determine if it is possible to turn array `a` into array `b` by performing the specified decrement operation on `a`. Here's an explanation of the key steps involved:

### 1. **Understanding the Decrement Operation**:

- Kristina can decrement each non-zero element in array `a` by 1 in a single operation.
- The problem asks whether we can make array `a` exactly equal to array `b` by applying this operation several times.

### 2. **Plan**:

- For each element `a[i]` and `b[i]`:
  - `a[i]` should be **greater than or equal** to `b[i]`, because we can only decrease values in `a`.
  - The difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` should be consistent across all elements of the array, meaning that if we can make one element equal, we should be able to make the others equal by decrementing the same number of times.

### 3. **Key Conditions**:

- **Difference (`dif`) Calculation**:

  - First, we calculate the minimum difference `dif` between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all elements where `b[i] != 0`. This tells us how many times we need to decrement `a[i]` to match `b[i]`.
  - If `b[i] == 0`, we don't care about its difference because once an element in `a` reaches zero, it can't decrease further.

- **Check Feasibility**:
  - If any element in `a` is already smaller than its corresponding element in `b` (`a[i] < b[i]`), it is **impossible** to match `a` to `b`, and the answer is "NO".
  - For each element `a[i]` and `b[i]`:
    - The difference `a[i] - b[i]` must be exactly equal to `dif` for all elements where `b[i] != 0`. If this condition is violated, it is impossible to achieve the transformation, and the answer is "NO".
    - Additionally, for elements where `b[i] == 0`, we check if `a[i]` can be reduced to 0 or less after applying the operations. If not, the answer is "NO".

### 4. **Code Walkthrough**:

- **`equals` function**:

  - The function checks if `a` can be transformed into `b` under the rules described.
  - The variable `dif` stores the smallest valid difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `b[i] != 0`.
  - It then checks if all `a[i]` can be reduced by this difference to match `b[i]`.

- **`solve` function**:
  - The function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `equals` to determine whether transformation is possible.

### 5. **Code Explanation**:

```cpp
bool equals(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b, int n) {
    const int inf = 1e9 + 7; // A large value representing infinity
    int dif = inf; // Initialize dif to infinity
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (b[i] != 0) // Find minimum difference for non-zero b[i]
            dif = min(dif, a[i] - b[i]);
    }
    if (dif < 0) return false; // If a[i] < b[i] for any i, return false
    if (dif == inf) return true; // If no non-zero b[i], always true (no transformation needed)

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Check if transformation is valid
        if (a[i] - b[i] > dif) return false; // Cannot reduce a[i] by more than 'dif'
        if (b[i] != 0 && a[i] - b[i] < dif) return false; // Differences must be consistent for non-zero b[i]
    }
    return true; // If all checks pass, transformation is possible
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n), b(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> a[i];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> b[i];
        cout << (equals(a, b, n) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n"); // Output result for each test case
    }
}
```

### 6. **Explanation of Test Case**:

- Example 1:
  - `a = [3, 5, 4, 1]`
  - `b = [1, 3, 2, 0]`
  - We can decrement each non-zero element of `a` twice to get `b`, so the answer is "YES".

### 7. **Conclusion**:

This approach efficiently checks whether it's possible to transform `a` into `b` by applying the decrement operation, ensuring the solution works within the time limits for large inputs.

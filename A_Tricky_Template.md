### Problem Breakdown:

You are given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` and need to determine whether there exists a "template" string `t` such that:

1. The strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. The string `c` does **not** match the template `t`.

A string `s` matches a template `t` if:

- If `t[i]` is a **lowercase** letter, then `s[i]` must be exactly the same as `t[i]`.
- If `t[i]` is an **uppercase** letter, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

Your task is to determine if such a template exists for each test case.

### Approach:

For each test case, you are provided with the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The goal is to find whether there exists a template `t` such that:

- The strings `a` and `b` match this template.
- The string `c` does not match this template.

Given that:

- If `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, `a[i]` and `b[i]` should both be equal to `t[i]`.
- If `t[i]` is an uppercase letter, `a[i]` and `b[i]` should both **not** be equal to the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
- However, `c[i]` should not match this template for at least one position `i`.

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Main Logic**:

   - Loop through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` (since the strings are of length `n`).
   - Check if both strings `a[i]` and `b[i]` **do not** match `c[i]`. This means there is a potential for a template where both `a` and `b` can match (since they differ from `c`), but `c` will not match.
   - If such a position is found, the result for that test case is "YES" (indicating that a valid template `t` exists). Otherwise, the result is "NO" (indicating no such template can be created).

3. **Output**: For each test case, print "YES" if a valid template exists, otherwise print "NO".

### C++ Code Explanation:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;  // number of test cases
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;  // length of the strings
        cin >> n;
        string a, b, c;
        cin >> a >> b >> c;

        bool found = false;
        // Loop through each character of the strings
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if both a[i] and b[i] are not equal to c[i]
            if (a[i] != c[i] && b[i] != c[i]) {
                found = true;  // We found a potential valid template
                break;
            }
        }

        // If a valid template is found, print YES, otherwise print NO
        if (found) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### How It Works:

1. **Input Example**:

   ```
   2
   3
   abc
   def
   ghi
   4
   abcd
   efgh
   ijkl
   ```

2. **Test Case 1**:

   - n = 3, strings: `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, `c = "ghi"`.
   - For all `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` both differ from `c[i]`. If at least one such index is found, we output "YES".

3. **Test Case 2**:
   - n = 4, strings: `a = "abcd"`, `b = "efgh"`, `c = "ijkl"`.
   - Similarly, check each position `i` and print the result accordingly.

### Edge Cases:

- If `n = 1`, only one comparison is needed.
- The algorithm efficiently checks for the existence of a valid template in **O(n)** time for each test case, which is fast enough given the constraints (n â‰¤ 20).

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity**: O(t \* n), where `t` is the number of test cases and `n` is the length of the strings.

The problem you're working on is based on probability, and involves determining whether Dreamoon ends up at the same position on the number line as intended, after interpreting some ambiguous commands. Let's break down the solution approach step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding:

- You are given two strings:
  - `s1`: the original commands (`+` or `-`).
  - `s2`: the commands received by Dreamoon (`+`, `-`, or `?` where `?` is an unrecognized command).
- You need to calculate the probability that Dreamoon ends up at the same position as originally intended, after interpreting the ambiguous `?` commands.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Target Position (Original Command `s1`)**:
   - The target position can be calculated by counting `+` as +1 and `-` as -1 in the original string `s1`.
2. **Received Command Interpretation (`s2`)**:
   - For each received command:
     - `+` means moving +1.
     - `-` means moving -1.
     - `?` means it could be either `+1` or `-1` with equal probability (0.5).
3. **Final Position Calculation**:
   - You need to find how many `?` are in `s2` and in how many ways Dreamoon could move so that his final position matches the target position.

### Approach:

1. **Compute the target position** based on `s1` by counting the number of `+` and `-`.
2. **Compute the received position** based on `s2` by counting the confirmed `+` and `-` (ignoring `?`).

3. **Count the number of unrecognized commands (`?`)**. These can either add or subtract from the final position, introducing variability.

4. **Use combinatorics** to calculate the number of ways the `?` commands can be interpreted to match the target position. This will involve finding a subset of the `?` commands that can make up the difference between the current recognized position and the target.

5. **Calculate the probability** by dividing the number of valid interpretations by the total number of possible interpretations (which is \(2^{\text{{number of `?`}}}\)).

### Solution Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate factorial for combinatorics
double factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    double res = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        res *= i;
    }
    return res;
}

// Function to calculate nCr (combinations)
double nCr(int n, int r) {
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r));
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    string s1, s2;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;

    int target_position = 0, current_position = 0, num_questions = 0;

    // Calculate the target position from the original commands (s1)
    for (char c : s1) {
        target_position += (c == '+') ? 1 : -1;
    }

    // Calculate the current position from the received commands (s2)
    // and count the number of '?'
    for (char c : s2) {
        if (c == '+') current_position += 1;
        else if (c == '-') current_position -= 1;
        else num_questions++;  // Count '?' which are unrecognized commands
    }

    // Calculate the difference between the current position and target position
    int difference = target_position - current_position;

    // Check if it's possible to reach the target position with the given '?' moves
    if (abs(difference) > num_questions || (difference + num_questions) % 2 != 0) {
        // If the difference is too large or odd, it's impossible to reach the target
        cout << fixed << setprecision(12) << 0.0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Now, calculate how many '+' we need among the '?' to make the positions match
    int moves_needed = (difference + num_questions) / 2;

    // Calculate the number of valid ways to achieve the target using combinations
    double valid_ways = nCr(num_questions, moves_needed);
    double total_ways = pow(2, num_questions);

    // Probability is the ratio of valid ways to total possible ways
    double probability = valid_ways / total_ways;

    cout << fixed << setprecision(12) << probability << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Factorial and Combination Calculation**:
   - The `nCr` function calculates combinations for distributing `+` and `-` across `?` commands.
2. **Logic**:
   - First, we compute the **target position** based on `s1` and the **current recognized position** from `s2`.
   - We then check if it's possible to match the positions with the available `?` moves.
   - If possible, we use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways we can interpret the `?` commands to reach the target position.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the required moves exceed the number of `?`, or the difference can't be split evenly between `+` and `-`, it's impossible to reach the target.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input:

```
+-+-   (s1)
+-??   (s2)
```

- Target position from `s1` = 0.
- Current position from `s2` = 0 (ignoring `?`).
- Number of `?` = 2.
- The difference between the current and target positions is 0, which is achievable by using 1 `+` and 1 `-` from the `?`.
- There are \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \) valid ways to do this, out of \(2^2 = 4\) total possibilities.
- Probability = \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \).

Output:

```
0.500000000000
```
